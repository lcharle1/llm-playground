This year’s Greenbelt Citizens Police Academy has received an overwhelming response, resulting in one of the largest classes yet. Due to the high number of applicants, police had to turn some applicants away.

“There’s definitely an interest out there for it. So that had me excited. You always want to have people who want to be present in your classes,” said Ricardo Dennis, the Greenbelt Police Department’s (GPD) public information officer.

The 10-week course, which began Thursday, March 7, allows attendees to learn more about police work and covers diverse topics like crime and patrol procedures, CPR, what to do in an active threat attack, de-escalation and more.
