**Paragraph 1 – The researcher and her mission**  
Susan Hengeveld, a longtime biologist and former frog‑neurophysiology specialist, now runs Indiana’s first Northern Saw‑Whet Owl banding station in Yellowwood State Forest.  Since inheriting the program in 2010, she and her husband Jim have spent each fall‑to‑winter night catching the tiny, secretive owls in fine‑mesh nets, fitting each bird with a metal band, and recording its weight, sex and wing measurements.  The long‑term dataset they maintain is crucial for revealing the true scale of the species’ migration—far more extensive and multidirectional than early scientists ever imagined.

**Paragraph 2 – Field work and mentorship**  
Banding season is a blend of meticulous fieldcraft and hands‑on teaching.  Volunteers, students and newcomers join Susan and Jim on nightly treks, listening for the faint owl calls with audio lures, checking nets, and finally freeing the captured birds.  Susan makes a point of handing the release to a first‑timer, believing that the tactile experience of holding a live owl ignites a lasting fascination with wildlife research.  Her own career, which began with frog vocalizations and evolved into a 30‑year tenure as a biology professor, informs her commitment to passing the torch before she retires.

**Paragraph 3 – A night in the woods**  
On a recent, wind‑still evening the crew set up two arrays of nets and audio lures, but after hours of listening only spider eyes reflected their headlamps.  When Susan finally closed the nets, a single, irritated saw‑whet was found tangled in the mesh.  A student named Grace gently placed the owl on her outstretched arm, waited for the bird to re‑orient, and then watched it launch into the darkness, a tiny flash of wingbeats that symbolizes the larger migration they are documenting.  With each release, Susan looks ahead to the next season’s captures, knowing the thousands of data points gathered now will help scientists track the owls’ movements for generations to come.
