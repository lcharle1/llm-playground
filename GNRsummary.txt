The Greenbelt Police Department’s Citizens Police Academy launched a 10‑week course on March 7, drawing the largest class the program has seen since the pandemic. With 12 participants—up from the prior year’s limited enrollment—the academy had to turn away additional applicants due to overwhelming interest. The curriculum blends classroom learning with hands‑on training and covers a broad range of topics, including crime and patrol procedures, CPR certification, active‑threat response, and de‑escalation techniques.

Program officials, such as public information officer Ricardo Dennis and Deputy Chief Tim White, say the academy’s goal is to give residents a realistic view of law‑enforcement work that contrasts with the dramatized portrayals seen on television. By exposing citizens to the day‑to‑day duties and decision‑making processes of officers, the academy aims to foster better understanding and communication between the department and the community.

Applicants must be 18 or older, have a connection to Greenbelt (by residence, work, or schooling), possess a clean criminal record, and attend at least 10 of the 12 sessions. The current cohort includes community members like TeArria Cannon as well as Councilmembers Jenni Pompi and Danielle McKinney. Organizers are enthusiastic about the high turnout and hope participants leave with practical skills—such as CPR and active‑shooter response—that they can use in everyday life.
